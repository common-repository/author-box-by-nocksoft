== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= How can I change the avatar for my author box? =

You have two options. Either through Gravatar, or you can use a local image in your user profile settings. This setting can be made separately for each user. But for this, you need to install the additional plugin "Local Avatars by Nocksoft" first.

= How can I change the biography about me? =

You can do this in your user profile settings.

= Where can I make settings for this plugin? =

You can adjust settings in the user profile settings and in the global settings under "Settings" -> "Author Box".

= What if I want to automatically display Author Box on all pages, but not on a specific page? =

You can add the following code in your functions.php and replace SAMPLEPAGE with your desired page:
`
add_action("wp_head", "remove_authorbox");
function remove_authorbox() {
	global $pagename;
	if (is_page() && function_exists("nstab_add_authorbox") && $pagename == "SAMPLEPAGE") {
		remove_action("the_content", "nstab_add_authorbox");
	}
}
`

= What if my theme also shows an author box? =

You have to disable the author box of your theme. How to do this depends on your theme. But for the WordPress default themes you will find a suitable setting in this plugins settings.
